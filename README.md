# Thrust_Vector_Rocket
Personal project - thrust vector rocket

Refer to the pdf presentation to read all the details about the project.

The folder "MATLAB" contains the analysis that I made on MATLAB/Simulink to stabilize the system.
I implemented three versions:
- "model 1" is a simplified model of the rocket, used only to study the dynamic of the system.
- "model 2" is a model of only the control of the gimble angle, no control on the thrust.
- "model 3" models a rocket where both the gimble angle and the thrust are controllable.

The folder "Arduino" contains the code that I uploaded on the controller of the physical rocket.

The folder "Structure" contains some of the CADs used in the physical rocket.
